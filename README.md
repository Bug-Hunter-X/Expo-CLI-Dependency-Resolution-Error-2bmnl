# Expo CLI Dependency Resolution Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Expo CLI: dependency resolution failure. The error occurs when the CLI is unable to successfully install or resolve the project's dependencies, preventing the project from building or running.

## Problem

The Expo CLI throws an error indicating that it can't install or resolve dependencies. This is often due to issues with the `package.json`, network connectivity problems, or incorrect configuration. 

## Solution

The solution involves verifying the `package.json`, checking network connectivity, clearing caches, and potentially reinstalling node modules.  The solution code provides an example of how to troubleshoot and resolve this problem.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. (If necessary) Introduce errors into `package.json` to simulate the problem (e.g., incorrect dependency versions or typos).
4. Run `expo start` or other expo commands to observe the error.
5. Follow the steps in `bugSolution.js` to fix the issue.
